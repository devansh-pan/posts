## Svelte

Svelte tops the list because of it's syntax.You can use svelte with it's meta framework sveltekit(built on top of vite) or with bare vite .

## React 

React has rich community so it is also a beginner friendly framework. If you stuck the is there to help you out.

## Astro 

Great for content rich websites and mostly static sites such as blog, news, docs etc .

### Conclusion

There are other UI frameworks, meta frameworks beside above listed which you can try.

Iam  using Svelte with Sveltekit , this site is also built with sveltekit.I do also like React(without nextjs). Astro is great for mostly  static sites but you can also use SSR for dynamic functionality with server islands.
